# AnoGAN for spectrogram of vascular access sound.
Repository for the code used in vascular access study.    
It was presented at the 30th Congress of Japan Association for Clinical Engineers in japanese. (2020.9.20)    
This dataset used in the study is also available that is the first public dataset that I know of that continuously tracks sounds of vascular access.    
I hope that this dataset will contribute to the development of this field.

## Contents
1. Convert sound of vascular access to spectrogram.
2. AnoGAN for spectrogram.

## Dataset overview
This dataset is based on recordings of vascular access sounds in dialysis patients.    
Since September 2019, we have been recording the sounds of one patient almost daily.   
 
A : Arterial side (at the anastomosis, near the wrist)     
V : Vein side (near the elbow)    

Only one sample of each is up here.     
All data is available for free download on kaggle and for more information, please refer to the following URL.
