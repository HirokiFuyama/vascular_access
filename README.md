# AnoGAN for spectrogram of vascular access sound.
Repository for the code used in vascular access study.

## Dataset overview
This dataset is based on recordings of vascular access sounds in dialysis patients.    
Since September 2019, we have been recording the sounds of one patient almost daily.   
 
A : Arterial side (at the anastomosis, near the wrist)     
V : Vein side (near the elbow)    

Only one sample of each is up here.     
All data is available for free download on kaggle and for more information, please refer to the following URL.

It is the first public dataset that I know of that continuously tracks sounds of vascular access.
I hope that this dataset will contribute to the development of this field.
